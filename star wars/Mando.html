            <p>Din Djarin, known as The Mandalorian, or Mando for short, orphaned as a young child, The Mandalorian was adopted into the Mandalorian culture and trained as a warrior, later becoming a bounty hunter and taking the title of his people as a sobriquet. The character is rarely seen without his silver, beskar helmet, which he is forbidden by creed to remove publicly.
            The Mandalorian accepts a commission from Bounty Hunters' Guild leader Greef Karga to collect a 50-year-old "child" named Grogu for a mysterious unnamed Client.

            During a raid, they stumble upon cloning experiments performed by Imperial scientists, involving the Child's blood, some of which has already been transfused to the clones to supposedly give them Force-sensitivity. Before they can learn more, they are forced to destroy the base and escape from the pursuing Imperial forces.

He meets Greef Karga, the leader of the bounty hunters guild, but he only offers low-paying bounties that will not cover travel expenses. Looking to get a bigger bounty, the Mandalorian accepts a mysterious commission for which Karga can only provide an address to meet the Client who wants the details of the job to be private.</p>
